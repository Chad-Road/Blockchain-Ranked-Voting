# Blockchain Ranked Voting
 ### A simple ranked choice voting system based on blockchain (hashed linked lists)

 Understanding the basics of blockchain, in its various forms is useful from both a general computing perspective as well as from the perspective of a Python learner. Many students say that during interviews one of the more common questions that they get during a Python technical interview is to explain what a linked list is and how one might be built from scratch in Python. Linked list being on of the first implmentations of lists or arrays from the earliest days of computing.
 
 Although the blockchain is a comparatively recent development in Computer Science, the basic structure and function of the blockchain is almost identical to that of a linked list: there is a value and a link to another value in the list. The link between each block or node is what keeps the essential structure of the system in place.

 Using this example of a blockchain voting system, we can practice manipulating linked lists, and later in the class, discuss how such a list or blockchain could be manipulated or cheated, and what functions of a blockchain might make manipulation somewhat more difficult than the simple linked list.
